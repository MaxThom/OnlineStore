# OnlineStore
Small project to learn ASP.NET using mvc and c#.

I used entity framework and ninject for my dependancy injection.
At the moment, the project is using hardcoded data for easier transportation and demo, 
but the classes for a real database are there and can be switch with ninject easily.

The project is just a simple online store where you can buy and order stuff.
There is an admin section to add new items. To access it, type "url"/admin.
The user is "admin" and password is "password"
